# Modal Animation Test Results

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

### **Problem**: Modal was closing immediately instead of sliding back to the right
### **Solution**: Added proper animation state management

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

1. **Added Animation State Management:**
   - Added `isAnimating` state to track animation progress
   - Added `onExitComplete` callback to reset animation state
   - Added `handleClose` function with proper timing

2. **Updated Close Handlers:**
   - Backdrop click now uses `handleClose`
   - Close button (X) now uses `handleClose`
   - Cancel button now uses `handleClose`

3. **Animation Timing:**
   - Exit animation duration: 300ms
   - Matches the spring animation duration
   - Proper state cleanup after animation

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Opening**: Modal slides in from right side smoothly
2. **Closing**: Modal slides out to right side smoothly
3. **No immediate disappearance**: Animation completes before modal is removed from DOM

## 🧪 **Test Steps:**

1. Click "+ Vehicle" button
2. Modal should slide in from right
3. Click X button or backdrop
4. Modal should slide out to right (not disappear immediately)
5. Repeat with "+ Vehicle + Driver" button

## 📝 **Files Updated:**

- `src/components/Masters/Vehicle/VehicleForm/VehicleFormModal.jsx`
- `src/components/Masters/VehicleDriverFormModal.jsx`
- `src/utils/modalAnimations.js` (global system)
- `src/components/common/AnimatedModal.jsx` (reusable component)

## ✅ **Status**: Ready for testing
